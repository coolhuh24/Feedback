Dear TeamCOFH
I really love your mods but there has been a problem lately.
The forge loading screen is 99% incompatible with your mods which is causing crash.
If you search the net , you will see numerous discussions about this.
Please code your mods so they become compatible with forge loading screen cause diabling forge loading screen is glitching the game.
I hope you will understand
Yours truly,
Ralph2405
